; Simplified answer
; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation
; See above for more info on the math
; in the first example we can see that A 1 evaluates to 2^y
; So (A 1 (A 2 3)) can be replaced with 2 to the power of (A 2 3)
; A 1 = Exponentiation
(A 2 4)
(A 1 (A 2 3))
(^ 2 (A 2 3))
(^ 2 (^ 2 (A 2 2)))
(^ 2 (^ 2 (^ 2 (A 2 1))))
(^ 2 (^ 2 (^ 2 2))) ; = 2 ^^ 4 = Tetration
65536
; based on the above, and Knuth's up-arrow notation, (A 2 4)
; is equal to 2^^4

Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the
procedures f, g, and h for positive integer values of n.

(define (f n) (A 0 n))
; 2n
; Got this

(define (g n) (A 1 n))
; 2^n 
; Looked this up but probably would have been able to work this out

(define (h n) (A 2 n))
; 0 for n=0, 2 for n=1, 2^2^… (n-1 times) for n>1
; NEVER would have been able to work this out.
; Even after writing out the case above. No way I would have gotten this
